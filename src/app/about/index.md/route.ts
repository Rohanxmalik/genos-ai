## What We Do

GenosAI builds custom AI systems — not templates, not white-labeled SaaS tools, not proofs of concept. Every system we deliver is production-grade from day one and built specifically for your business processes, data, and goals.

Core services: AI chatbot development ($1,500–$5,000), voice AI agents ($2,500–$8,000), workflow automation ($500–$3,000), AI marketing automation ($1,000–$4,000), AI lead qualification ($800–$3,500), and custom AI solutions ($5,000–$25,000+).

## How We Work

1. **Free strategy call** — Audit your workflows, identify automation opportunities, scope your project.
2. **Firm quote and timeline** — Clear scope, price, and delivery date before any work begins.
3. **Build and iterate** — Build in sprints with regular progress updates. Working software early, not slide decks.
4. **Deploy and hand off** — Deploy to production, document everything, ensure your team can operate independently.
